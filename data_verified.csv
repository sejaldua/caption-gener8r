I must work through these burdens of pain and bitterness in order to realign myself to my highest potential. I really didnt think social media would be such a trigger to me at this point but it is and I have so much more to focus on and prioritise in myself at this current time. as much as I appreciate those who are supporting me I also find that this platform enables alot of reckless and immature behaviour on me- This is very scattered because I am high as a kite but I hope you can all allow me the opportunity to change, to grow and to acknowledge my mistakes in my own time... My recent comments I made were inappropriate and attention seeking and I need to readjust my mindset and inform myself on a number of various issues and topics that I still lack adequate knowledge for. I am on the biggest journey to find love and acceptance in myself and I know I can get there, I just need time, patience and Grace. I hope you all take care of yourselves, I'll be sure to do the same and work on nothing but engraining the highest of prospects for myself and others"

Dear Mrs Meth.

Seeping into the bloodstream, a torch right to the tounge.
You dispersed into my chambers, circulating into my lungs.
Dismantled into the depths of fear, dispatched in a delarious mind.
A final destination, a poison to everything she finds.
A fraction of hesitation, enticed by a cheeky thrill.
She said 'Watch me flip your life around, then send it all downhill'

Infectious initial indulgment, a creamy first timers hit.
Oblivious to the discoveries, desination to a darkened pit.

Flames furnish sacred utilities, in ways which seem so formal.
A fractured crystal, with heat inside- I hope you're acting normal.
Vaporized entities, demons and all the gore.
Consuming fumes with credibility.
I believe my tounge is sore.

Providence to a portal in a state which none compare.
Emerging out the gate with wings, let's reap these sins fuck fear.
Witholding authority & influence, an ability to entice.
Hiding her potential potency, her name was Crystal ice.

Hijack my mind, become unkind.
No soul left to apease.
She states that shes all kinds of fun, but she will bring you to your knees.

Diffusing into the stale thin air,
so soon this heat would come. Transforming pain into despair, a life stripped of all fun.

Warning of all dangers shes invasive in all risks, so lit.
Disregarded, caused by the cravings...all for the next pure, white shard hit... Sinnicle scenes and cosmic laser beams, meth will leave you all distorted.
Subtracted fees, a great big tease.
Meth will leave you soon, unescorted."

Maori & Irish... Just because my skin is white, that DOES NOT define race.... Most of my mothers family have dark skin why the FUCK would I have any ill intent towards those whose skin tone is of a difference to my own. This is the problem with America & the media... They keep drip feeding this dialogue of racism that it truly has almost turned into a reverse issue... The amount of times I have been called an 'entitled white person' is a JOKE. First of all I am not white so please do not define me as such until you have done research on the suppression my own culture has faced within the confinements of it's own country. Second of all I'm a trans woman... I have had to fight and face enough of the discriminatory slander that the world has thrown at me. So on a final note GET FUCKED I AINT NO RACIST NIGGA BITCH. & also most of the black people coming at me for my viewpoints ain't ever been locked up or faced true belittlement for their ways of being- I HAVE SO GET FUCKED before you label me as racist get your own self in check first because there are lots of racist bitches out there whose skin colour is anything but white... Make sure you are clean yourself before you try drag somebody else down... Does this make you uncomfortable... Because good it should."

It will distort your sense of judgment first and then feast on you mind, playing games. This substance will then seep into your soul and torment you with your greatest insecurities and showcase you your most taunting fears with distortions and altered truths. I can honestly say if you are an open and vulnerable soul like me, DO NOT EVER fuck with meth. Dark entities and energy matter that surround this drug will attempt to hijack you and use your body and mind as a vessel to destroy and cause chaos. The first high is bait because you will never achieve one like it again, it's not worth it. I am very sick at the moment, and I must heal. I must refine myself and rebuild as strong of a core being as I can, practicing resilience everyday. I know if i continue with my addiction it's going to absolutely strip me of everything I've known and leave me as an empty skeleton. I DONT WANT THAT

I must face up to THIS. And confront all my demons so I can discard of them for good. This addiction will NOT overthrow me."

Y’all are truly family. #Leica #LeicaCamera #LeicaCameraUSA #LeicaM #LeicaM10P #LeicaM10Ptyp3656 #🔴📷 #Summilux #Summilux50mm #LeicaCraft #MyLeicaJourney #MKexplore #drandallblythe #RatsEyesPhotography #HoneTheAesthetic #SLAYER"

It’s an age-old existential question: “Why am I here?” It’s all too easy to fall into a cynical pit of despair, esp. in this hyper-connected world. All you have to do is see the news & you can easily start adopting a combative nihilistic attitude- “Look at all this strife, both domestically & internationally– what’s the point?” And maybe things are, in fact, pointless– maybe we are screwed. However, if that’s the case, I know I feel better in this pointless existence if I’m at least TRYING to make things better- I also don’t like giving up, it feels weak. So I have to look at what I’m good at; what my history has qualified me to do- in a macro sense, I’m good at making music, writing, & photography- I’m an artist. People have told me that art I’ve made, no matter how poor, has helped them. So I need to make the best art that I can, whether it’s music, prose, or photos; art with SUBSTANCE & INTENT. On a personal, micro-level, I’m good at relating to people with substance abuse problems, because I was a freaking train wreck for over two decades. So I need to talk, ONE ON ONE, & IN PERSON, with people like me- drunks & drug addicts- & at least try to let them know that there is a better way. I can’t cure anyone- no one can- but I can at least show them that just in this very moment, right now, TODAY... I am still on the other side of a long struggle with the bottle. Other people did that for me; they SHOWED ME it was possible- if I’m not willing to do the same, then I am just an asshole. So when I look at this photo of this man passed out drunk on the street, I can’t view it as “Look at that scummy bum!”, but instead as “I’ve been that man passed out on the street. I cannot judge him. I can only see that he is still alive, & therefore, has a chance at getting better- maybe when he wakes up, he’ll be sober enough to accept help.” Performing my broader proper functions to the best of my ability, & trying to relate on a INDIVIDUAL level, is the best way I can help bring about positive change. This is something to think about- WHAT IS YOUR FUNCTION? #LeicaM240p"

I took this shot of @greghetson backstage when my band played in Frankfurt a couple of weeks ago- he’s touring Europe w/@markyramoneofficial & came out to see lamb of god play on a day off. Greg played in Redd Kross, @badreligionband, & of course was (and is) an OG member of the mighty @circlejerksband. In between getting ready to play & trying not to fanboy out too hard on him (because I know how annoying that shit is), I suddenly realized “Holy crap, this dude played the first show I ever got thrown out of!” In 1988 the Circle Jerks were on tour w/@official7seconds- I went to see them play at The Boathouse in Norfolk, VA. I watched all of 7 Seconds, & made it about 1/4 of the way through the Circle Jerks before this huge bouncer with a long-ass coke nail threw my skinny ass out the side door- this happened during one of my favorite Circle Jerks songs, “Making the Bombs.” I don’t remember exactly why I got thrown out out- it could have been fighting. It could have been drinking (I was only 17 at the time, but it would not surprise me.) Or it could have been for nothing at all (that shit happened from time to time, especially if the bouncer was an asshole, which this one definitely was.) What I do remember is that he cut my thumb with his pointy-ass coke nail, & up until a year or two ago, I could still plainly see the scar- it’s really faint now, but it’s still there. Man, I was mad at that bouncer- I tried to punch him but he just laughed & tossed my scrawny teen-aged ass almost into the water beside the Boathouse 😂😂😂. The dude I came to the show with left w/a hot punk rock girl too, & I was stuck in the parking lot alone & all pissed off with a bleeding thumb. DAMMIT, MAN- as Charles Manson (supposedly) said “Sometimes, things just don’t work out.” Anyways, that was the first show I ever got the boot from, & Mister Hetson was there onstage rocking & rolling away, so it was really cool for me to have him come see us perform 31 years later (conversely, Greg was very well behaved & did NOT get thrown out of our show.)

Both logically flesh out a glaringly obvious problem: we spend way too much time looking at little screens, & as a result we are suffering. Sean Parker, billionaire inventor of Napster & early Facebook investor spoke publicly at a 2017 Axios event about designing social media’s addictive properties: 'The inventors, creators—it's me, it's Mark [Zuckerberg], it's Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it's all of these people--understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.' I know that I spend way too much time looking at Instagram, YouTube, & the horror show 24/7 news cycle. So for 31 days I’m deleting Instagram/Youtube from my phone & moving my web browser to a folder off my home screen. For the news (which I compulsively check, constantly cross-referencing about 7 different outlets varying from far left to far right leaning in order to get a feel for the average “spin of the day”- WHY? I already know what they are going to say!), I’m only going to look at WWW.ALLSIDES.COM which presents 3 different stories on each major news item (one each from a left, right, & center weighted news network), with no ads. Instagram is my only social media, & as it has brought REAL-WORLD value to my life, not just “likes”, which are empty digital baubles designed to give cheap serotonin hits (real world value I’ve gotten: information & business connections in photography, writing, music, & acting/ the ability to promote other artists & charitable causes I support/ actual in-person lasting friendships/ & most importantly... a growing surfing posse 😂), I’m not ready to delete my account. But it’s obvious that I need to evaluate my relationship w/this technology, & change it for the better. Why am I posting this instead of just vanishing? Because I hope it will make YOU, the reader, dig deep & ask yourself an honest question: WHAT AM I ACTUALLY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR? Does it make you feel NERVOUS to think about stepping away from it? If so, that might be worth examining. See you in 31 days with a report- live long & prosper.

While we love the big waves they create, we hate the destruction they bring. It’s perfect when hurricanes form and stay out to sea, bringing us waves but not smashing into the land or creating massive storm surge. Regrettably, as of right now Dorian doesn’t look like a storm that is gonna play nice & just give us pretty waves- in fact it’s a Category 5, currently ripping into the Bahamas (oh btw, now is actually an appropriate time for “thoughts & prayers” for the people on those islands), then it’s gonna travel up the Southern East Coast on a still undecided path. If you are a new transplant to our coast, my advice is prepare for the absolute worst & be ready to leave. Don’t think that the government is gonna come in, save you, and fix everything, because they ain’t- hell, FEMA hasn’t even had confirmed leadership since March, just an acting administrator, & it’s not like they are gonna replace everything you lost anyway- that’s not their job. So gas up the car & be ready to split ASAP- it looks like it could get ugly. If you’ve never ridden out a hurricane, I can promise you it’s like nothing you’ve ever experienced before- it makes a regular thunder storm look like a trip to Disney Land. So shout out to all my locals in FL, GA, SC, & NC- y’all already know what to do. To you newcomers, I’d advise you watch this storm, take it seriously, & be ready to split waaaaay before it gets near you. I took this photo a few days ago on a surf trip to the Outer Banks- here’s hoping Dorian tracks away & we’ll have light, kite-flying winds again soon... #Leica #LeicaCamera #LeicaCameraUSA #LeicaM #LeicaM10P #LeicaM10Ptyp3656 #🔴📷 #Summicron #Summicron75mm #LeicaCraft #MadeInWetzlar #MKexplore #drandallblythe #RatsEyesPhotography #HoneTheAesthetic"

Inlanders, pay attention: THE OCEAN IS NOT A SWIMMING POOL OR A LAKE. It has its own rules, & you have to learn & respect them. A rip current is a sort of river flowing out into the ocean- if you are caught in one, it will carry you out to sea, & it will do so very quickly. If you are swimming or even standing in shallow water & notice that suddenly you are far away from the beach, & that you can’t seem to swim back, you are more than likely caught in a rip current. #1. DO NOT PANIC. A rip current isn’t going to carry you a mile out to sea, & it’s not gonna “suck you under”- there is no such thing as an “undertow” (yes, I know my band has a song called “The Undertow”.) Just chill & don’t try to fight it- if you panic & fight it, you will get tired quickly & drown. #2. DO NOT TRY TO SWIM DIRECTLY BACK TOWARDS SHORE- instead, SWIM PARALLEL TO SHORE- most of the time this will get you out of the rip current & you can make your way back. Rip currents are scary, even for experienced swimmers- I’ve been in the ocean since I was four years old, & a few years ago I got caught in a weird rip/sink hole thing at Manhattan Beach in Cali. I was starting to get freaked out until I just swam a mere ten yards to my right & popped out of it, no problem. One minute I was in knee deep water, & within seconds I was wondering why I was in up to my neck & couldn’t get back in- it was scary. DON’T PANIC & YOU WON’T DROWN. Also, if you are not a strong enough swimmer to swim the length of a football field no problem, you probably shouldn’t be cruising out into the ocean very far at all. Those are just facts. Ok, PSA done. Enjoy the beach, pick up your trash (& other peoples), & don’t forget sunscreen- there is nothing more tragic than ruining your vacation by looking like a boiled lobster & feeling like you’re ON FIRE."

I gotta watch stuff in slow motion to deconstruct tricks & grasp their mechanics, hahaha. So it was nice to see the Swedish youth out ripping some good ol’ Bertslides today- it instantly took me back about 35 years; to being a kid & just feeling that joy of going low and fast & feeling the wheels sliding across the street frontside as you try to stay on the board.

So last night I went out to eat with @wlee718 & like 15 other dudes from the Slayer road crew, along with Tom & Kerry from the band. After we were done eating & taking pictures with restaurant employees & fans who happened to be there too, we all went outside to get ready to leave. We were milling about in front of the restaurant talking & laughing (as we do on off-day dinners) when I see two dudes walking up the street towards us. One guy looked TOTALLY NORMAL, and the other was for some utterly unknown reason dressed up like a Dragon Ball Z character- Tuesday night cosplay? He’s a real-life Canadian superhero on patrol? I don’t know- I just knew a GOLDEN opportunity was approaching. So I look over at @tomarayaofficial & say “I’m gonna ask this dude to take a picture with you.” I go up to the guy and say “Hey man- my friend is a HUGE Dragon Ball Z fan- do you mind if I take a picture of you with him?” He looked a little confused for a second but said “Sure!” (I mean, if you’re walking down the street looking like that, you HAVE to expect photos.) So Tom walked over & I snapped like 8 shots real quick. The best part of this is that the dude obviously had ZERO idea of who Tom was, & Tom obviously had ZERO idea of what Dragon Ball Z was- it was just SO AWKWARD that everyone started laughing, including the dude. There is an imp 😈 inside of me that that glories in awkward & uncomfortable situations- I have a great love of the ABSURD. That imp said to me last night “Randy, let’s make this happen & share it with the world.” So here you go! Thanks @tomarayaofficial for always being a good sport, & thanks Canadian Goku for being cool as well! Maybe Canadian Goku will see this one day & become a @slayerbandofficial fan! #Leica #LeicaCamera #LeicaCameraUSA #LeicaM #LeicaM10P #LeicaM10Ptyp3656 #🔴📷 #Summilux #Summilux35mm #LeicaCraft #MyLeicaJourney #MKexplore #drandallblythe #RatsEyesPhotography #HoneTheAesthetic"

This is my bro, @alexskolnick backstage at @hellfestopenair festival last month. Alex is, of course, most famous as the guitarist of @testamentofficial, but he’s also a highly trained & accomplished jazz player who tours the world with his @alexskolnicktrio. He’s a published author, & was a co-editor of @unbuiltmag with me & @tomb_and_jennifer. Alex & I first bonded over books & movies at a show our bands played together in Asia, & we’ve had many good deeply nerdy talks since then (my FAVORITE types of talks.) A few tours ago our bands were together, & we started talking photography. He was interested in getting started with that- Alex has “an eye”, as we say, so I loaned him my #LeicaQ (in my humble opinion, THE PERFECT CAMERA for a beginner to learn the fundamentals with- fixed 28mm lens without a ton of bells & whistles- this forces you to really learn how to properly frame & expose a shot), & I did a bit of tutoring about the exposure triangle, composition, etc. At the end of the tour, the bug had bitten so he went out & got his own Q- I’m looking forward to seeing his shots from around the world. I freaking LOVE photography, & I love Leicas, & I love seeing the world through my friends’s eyes. Welcome to the #Leica family, Alex, you handsome renaissance man- I hope we get to go out and shoot together soon! #Leica #LeicaCamera #LeicaCameraUSA #LeicaQ #Summilux #Summilux28mm #LeicaCraft #🔴📷 #MyLeicaJourney #MKexplore #streetdreamsmag #streetphotography #RatsEyesPhotography #HoneTheAesthetic #alexskolnick #testament #alexskolnicktrio"

Terry is currently the bass player in MY FAVORITE DEATH METAL BAND OF ALL TIME, the almighty @obituaryband. I’ve toured & done gigs across the globe with him w/Obituary & during his time in Six Feet Under- he’s always been awesome to me & my posse, just an all around gentle giant & class act, so my heart aches for his loss. The only good thing about this is that his grandsons (who were in the wreck) survived & are ok- now they are living with Terry, who has had to leave tour (Obituary are on the road with Hatebreed still) to come home & take care of his family. This is a blessing, but here is the reality of the situation- in our community, you can be in a band and tour the world and have fans and still not be a bazillionaire. A sudden tragedy like this can put a severe financial strain on a touring musician, ESPECIALLY if they can’t tour- it’s how we make a living, and if you want to be rich, you sure as hell aren’t gonna choose a career in death metal, of all things. That’s just REALITY, so a GoFundMe page has been established to help Terry out with raising his grandsons. The other reality of the situation is that in the underground music scene, WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN- I’ve seen it time and time again. So the link to the GoFundMe is IN MY BIO- if you can spare a few bucks, please take a second & kick down- I just did. The dude already raised his children, now he’s got to raise his grandchildren, & that costs money. So if you’ve ever rocked out to an Obituary, Six Feet Under, or Death song, kick down a few bucks- Terry’s a legend who played in all those bands- this is his life, it has always been his life, & it ain’t like he’s suddenly gonna become a rich lawyer or something. Thanks for your time in reading this, & Terry, I’m so sorry for your loss. Love to you & your family. - D. Randall Blythe"

(PLEASE SEE PREVIOUS POST) Today ends my 31 day social media hiatus (Instagram is my only form of social media.) What did I find? I did NOT miss it; furthermore, I did not miss ANYTHING important- life goes on just fine without social media. Who cares about missing the intellectually lightweight idiocy of memes, ill thought-out online political arguments, trolls of all sorts, & freaking selfies? Not me- my brain is clearer without that stuff. So while I will use Instagram to post stuff I care about (AS A TOOL, not just something to kill time), I will no longer have it on my phone (I’ll just erase it after each post- POOF!) As for my attempt to not look at news sites so much... embarrassingly, I must admit to TOTAL FAILURE. I’m a news/politics junkie, & still found myself checking multiple sites several times a day, even though I KNOW BETTER & am aware of sensationalism & bias in the news media, both left & right (heck, I even wrote a song about it, “Engage the Fear Machine”) Still I got suckered into the endless horror show, & made these douchebags more advertiser dollars with every click (because that is what it’s all about people- ADVERTISING DOLLARS.) As an alcoholic who has been sober several years now, I’m keenly aware of when I’m displaying addictive behavior- it doesn’t feel good. These “smart phones” (originally solely designed just so you wouldn’t have to carry an iPod & a phone at the same time) are distraction machines. So I’m installing an app that restricts the web browser on my phone in order to curtail this ridiculous news habit of mine. Sad, but true. I took this photo on a cruise ship my band played on- as we were at sea, there was no cell service or internet. I heard people complaining as if this was some sort of savage punishment- for me, it was paradise, hence the title of this photo (if you don’t know what Shangri-La is, read “Lost Horizon”- in fact, just read a book in general. It’s way better for you than looking at social media.) I’m not anti-technology, or against smart phones or even social media- just the way they are used most of the time. Are you using technology, or being used? Think..."

I met Cameron working in Hollywood- we did some acting together for an upcoming production. Cameron was a Disney child actor, now growing into a young man- he was just 20 years old when he died last night of natural causes due to an ongoing medical condition. Despite being famous as a child star, he was as about as down to earth as a person could get, which greatly impressed me- there was absolutely zero sense of entitlement about him. We had a lot of laughs on set, not to mention good talks on the nature & perils of fame. Cameron was incredibly talented- he could dance, sing, & was a brilliant actor with a great sense of humor & a genuine curiosity about the world- just truly a joy to watch perform. I would watch him on set doing his thing & think “Man- he’s SO GOOD.” Incidentally, his paternal grandmother, Jo Ann (Allen) Boyce, is a Civil Rights icon, one of the first 12 African-Americans to attend an integrated high school in the south, in 1956- I believe that this sort of upbringing lead to his strength of character, & philanthropic nature. Although he & I came from very different worlds- the Disney scene & the heavy metal music world are pretty much polar opposites- we got along well & I was really looking forward to seeing & working with him again. I extend my most sincere condolences to Cameron’s family & friends. The world needs more socially aware & kind hearted young men, & we certainly lost a good one last night.

I’m posting about this (as I always do) to let people know that they can avoid the hideously over-priced EBay Vampires ($60 to $85 to even almost $300) & get a signed, even personalized copy of my book (hardback or softcover) at a REGULAR PRICE. Also, you will be supporting a locally-owned, independent business. I SUPPORT INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES!!! I bought 2 books yesterday (as I almost always do when I go to @fountainbookstore.) Now, to answer a few questions that always get asked when I do this:

A) “Will @fountainbookstore ship to Canada/Italy/Cambodia/any-other-country-that-is-not-the-USA?” Yes. They will ship ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

B) “When will you go to Fountain next to sign books?” When I get around to it- I travel A LOT, not just with my band. Normally I go down there to sign every 3 or 4 months or so. Fountain contacts me when they have a bunch of orders together & I go sign. PATIENCE, grasshopper! C) “I already own your book- can I send it to the bookstore for you to sign & send back to me?” No. This is a bookSTORE, not Randy’s P.O. Box. They need to SELL BOOKS to stay alive. If you already have my book & we ever meet, I will be MORE THAN HAPPY to sign it to you, absolutely free of charge! And no, you can’t send it to me- I am untrustworthy & lazy & always busy doing a zillion things already. I will most likely lose your book or sell it to fund a surf trip.
D) “Will you make it out to: Micronishiz Zelda the Valkyrie Conquerer?” Yes. I will personalize it to anyone, no matter how weird your name is. Yes, I will say “Happy Anniversary, Becky” or whatever. No, I will not write “I love you” on it- DON’T BE CREEPY. No, I will not write out all the lyrics to (insert lamb of god song here.) Also, sorry- I will NO LONGER be enclosing my spectacular nude self-portraits with each order. The demand was WAAAAAAY too high, & the government was trying to hit me with unlicensed pornography distribution charges.
E) “How do I order your book?” Go to WWW.FOUNTAINBOOKSTORE.COM, look around, search for “Dark Days” & it will pop up!"

In his honor, I had to bust out my brand new Blade Runner shirt (designed by the amazing artist, @godmachine- check his work out- so sick.) I freaking love this shirt- the graphic is Rachael, another replicant from the film. Blade Runner was and is an very important film that continues to broadly impact culture to this day.

Some days I’m better then others. That’s all I guess we can really ask of ourselves. Some days I feel terrible, somedays I feel fat. Other days I feel ok, today I feel inadequate, sometimes I feel confident and other times I don’t know if I feel anything and all. The best days are when I feel loved. When I feel accomplished. The days you feel like life is moving in the right direction. That’s not today though. I don’t know why that is. Why somedays you just wake up not quite as bright as the day before. I don’t know what exactly causes that when nothing has changed from yesterday to today.i do know that it’s ok to have those days. I do know that just because you’re down doesn’t mean you need cheering up. I do know, there’s always tomorrow. Hope everyone out there realizes you’re ENOUGH. You’re most likely right where you should be. Things will get better, things will sometimes feel worse. And that’s OK. #betheadventure #selfie #mood photo @ndrewstuart"

Ricks a single dad who works extremely hard and has no insurance. There’s is a GOFUND ME link in my bio and my story - every dollar helps if you can spare a few quarters... if that’s not enough he also suffers from hair loss, so even when he heals from this he still will have to live a life of hairlessness and massive financial burden of always needing sunblock . thanks in advance for any help or positive thoughts! #betheadventure #gofundme #bmx #bro #slam #hospital"

I realized today the 4 of us were gonna be in the same place. @tajlucas @rubenalcantara @t1ers and I were apart of the @etniesbmx team. We all had signature shoes by Etnies in the early 2000s . It was during a time that the 4 of us all had an opportunity to influence 4 very specific, but different kinds of riders. It was a special time for us and Bmx. I feel lucky I got to be apart of a time that helped shape generations of future bike riders with these guys. We toured together, competed against each other, traveled all over the world as teammates ,at times hated each other and respected each other. I’ve learned something from each one of them. Some of my biggest early life lessons was from Taj. Driving from OKC to Ann Arbor Michigan then to Bethlehem, Pa. when I was probably 17. Which are things that I still check myself on. We’ve all done a lot of growing over the past 25 years of knowing each other. Some wonderful , some growing pains. But I have to say it was really nice seeing all of you today. What a wonderful journey we all went on. #betheadventure #etnies #bmx #forward #grounded #travel"

Earlier this year I had skydive accident that I didn’t see coming while working a commercial. As you can see from this picture I pretty much look dead. My canopy deployed instantaneously. So instead of going from 130 Ish mph to maybe 20 mph gradually over 6-10 seconds it happened in about a half second. Which was like getting hit by a truck. the impact of the jerk was so harsh I actually thought someone else ran into me in the air. The initial jerk blacked me out from the G- forces, bruised my chin on my chest from it hitting it and vice Versa, caused 2 full leg strap bruises, bent and tweaked my back as it stopped me and kinked my neck and cracked my neck like I’ve never had happen before. As you can see the filmer @travisfienhage caught the whole opening right in front of him, which isn’t normal. I got lucky, my buddy @brandonlillard broke his back on something similar and I was told necks get broken like this every once in awhile. Luckily I fully came too about 30-60 seconds after this. Took a few seconds to evaluate myself shake off the daze as much as I could check my gear and fly to my landing area where I came in on my butt and just sat there for a bit cause I was still very much in pain and disoriented. Thankful I have guys like @travisfienhage in my corner constantly testing me and reminding me to stay up to date, aware and just all around in general never to get complacent in what we do. We studied the footage to see if I had done something that caused it - Still not sure why it happened, could of been the packers error not tucking my slider correct, could of been just dumb luck, doesn’t much matter to me - but I learned a huge lesson that day - things happen you have no control over. All you can do is be mentally prepared for it all. #betheadventure #skydive #outdoors #slam #canopy @gopro #gopro #gpathlete"

For the small peasants, who have kept us alive for thousands of years.
For all those who through the centuries have protected springs and forests to leave our children a planet as fertile as they found it.
Let us pray.
For all those peasants without a name who have preserved seeds and guarded their know-how and given it – not sold it – to the future generations. For all those peasants who have protected and delivered us the greatest wealth there is: biodiversity.
Let us pray.
For the unknown person who planted the hedges to live together with animals and insects, who planted trees to give shade and relief to flocks and shepherds.
For all those who didn’t poison what feeds us.
Let us pray.
For all those peasants who suffered misery and poverty but offered the world beauties and marvels and landscapes.
For this moving testimony whereby human beings can live in harmony with nature, not geared toward profit and without destroying all ressources.
For all those peasants who have been exploited and humiliated by the landlords of all the times.

Elle m'a dit, un jour j'irais rejoindre Jacques ici et ça semblait lui faire plaisir. Agnès croyait en l'amour, au couple, aux couples, elle disait que faire les choses à deux c'est beau, que savoir qu'on peut compter sur l'autre, c'est merveilleux.

Repost @socialanimals :
The short film 'Les Bosquets' -2015- brings the audience in a place where art, social uproar and the power of image interweave. It is based on the performance of Les Bosquets at New York City Ballet -2014-, inspired by the riots in the French suburbs in 2005. JR initiated his first project, Portrait of a Generation, in 2004, in the suburbs of Les Bosquets, in Clichy-Montfermeil.This iconic image is the poster of the film."

On Nov. 9, 1989 the Berlin Wall fell. A few weeks ago, I installed a GIANT in Berlin on the Brandenburg Gate. I used an archival image made by Iris Hesse on November 10, 1989, on this place symbolizing the division then the reunification of Germany.
I work frequently around walls. The walls that separate, (Face2Face and Kikito); the walls that are destroyed at a loss for the memory of a place (Wrinkles of the City, Destruction serie in Les Bosquets); the walls that we try to build again, in concrete or in our minds. The Brandenburg Gate was part of a wall that represented the division of Europe following the failure of a mass murder ideology. It separated women and men who lived in two opposite systems of thought. The opening of this Gate has kindled a wind of freedom that has engulfed millions of Europeans

L'avancée en âge et la pauvreté sont des facteurs aggravants de leur isolement, jusqu'à les rendre invisibles.

Repost @galleriacontinua ・・・
After our first collaboration in #Cuba, during the 13th Havana Biennial, we are pleased to announce the continuity of our projects, the next ones in Italy and again in #Cuba, with #JR, an artist that exhibits freely in the streets of the world and celebrates people.
_
#JR work mixes Art and Action; it talks about commitment, freedom, identity and limit. Sharing the same desire of opening conversations, starting dialogues
and building connections between people through Art. We very much look forward to more exciting adventures together!
_
The artist’s largest exhibition to date is currently presented at the #BrooklynMuseum, in New York! Entitled'JR: Chronicles' the exhibition traces the artist's career from his early documentation of graffiti artists as a teenager in Paris to his large-scale architectural interventions in cities worldwide to his more recent digitally collaged murals that create collective portraits of diverse publics.

Pace is pleased to present 'The Chronicles of San Francisco - Sketches,' an exhibition of new work by French artist and photographer JR (@jr), on view at Pace’s gallery in Palo Alto from February 6 – March 24, 2019. Encompassing portraits, works on paper, video installations, lightboxes, and etched glass works, the exhibition is derived from and inspired by JR's upcoming monumental mural project 'The Chronicles of San Francisco,' opening at SFMOMA (@SFMOMA) in Spring 2019.
-
Known for his large-scale urban works that address socio-economic and political issues, JR created the new series in honor of the city and people of #SanFrancisco. The city’s long muralist tradition and its stark contrasts—featuring both immense innovation and wealth as well as one of the country’s highest rates of child homelessness—has made it a vibrant and complex site for the artist to explore and capture. Over the course of the project, nearly 1,200 people were filmed, photographed and interviewed; each person choosing the way they were to be represented in the mural.
-
“In a painting, it’s usually the perspective that focuses the attention of the viewer. With this new mural technique, we break the perspective: Every person is presented at the same size, captured with the same light. No one is more important than another. It is not a group photo, but rather a group of photos...The mural aims to be a picture of society, not depicting good and bad, but rather showing that both sides are present in everyone.”—#JR

As a photojournalist, I have become increasingly aware of how my travel impacts the environment, and I do everything necessary to offset my footprint. This year I took one of my first vacations, in many years, to Mexico, where I experienced a sustainable hospitality model. Tomorrow, I'm on my way back to research, explore, photograph and report on what makes a sustainable hospitality model work. I'll be traveling to the delicate ecosystem that has been ravaged by tourisim: #Tulum, #Mexico. Stay tuned for more stories from the field as I dive deep into what makes hospitality entreprenuers, communities and travelers unite for a common good.

In the mean time, I want to know your questions, concerns, thoughts feelings about travel and tourism. Comment below!

The “Sky Caves of Mustang” are a large collection of 10,000 or more man-made caves dug into the sides of a valley in northern #Nepal. Archeologists and researchers have explored a fraction of these caves and have found mummified human remains dating to at least 2,000-3,000 years old. .
As the world becomes smaller, exploration and discovery shifts and changes in meaning as well. Archeologists on our expedition required the support of climbers, like myself and @mattsegal, to access these caves. Just as the printing press changed history, advent of digital dissemination of not just the written word, but visual stories have altered the way we connect, research, explore and communicate. How do you feel discovery, exploration and science has changed through new world of Instagram? .

Mani stones are plates or rocks inscribed with the 6 syllables Tibetan Buddhist mantra 'Om Mani Padme Hum'. They can be found everywhere--from the sides of roads and rivers to the walls of temples. Carving these stones can also be a devotional practice, or 'sadhana'.
.
There are many translations of this mantra, and @dalailama says 'The six syllables..can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into the pure body, speech and mind of the Buddha... All beings naturally have Buddha nature... We have within us the seed of purity, the Buddha-Essence, that can be transformed and fully developed.'

Many have asked if we are about to go climb, but the honest answer is the winds are high and we are bored. So, to occupy our time, as well as to keep the psych level up, we started preparing what we could. Based on weather, we most likely won’t be able to get on the new route again for another 2 weeks. Thank you everyone for the well wishes, the prayers, the kind thoughts and the funny notes. It helps us pass the time and makes it all feel a little less lonely.
Regardless of being psyched and excited it still is a mental challenge to battle the internal conversations of loneliness, fear and everything in between. With May being #mentalhealthawarenessmonth, it is important to me to share both the good and the realities that come with climbing this route, not just as an alpinist, but as someone who lives with #bipolar and an advocate for furthering the conversation around #mentalhealth
Pictured here, Topo and I maneuver to the base of the route to stow our gear for when the time is right. Planning and preparations is integral to a successful and safe climb.

The conditions we encountered coupled with our chosen tactics compounded by exertion meant that we had to turn back at around 7,600 m. Downclimbing safely took another 7 hours from our high point. Back in ABC and reassessing our approach, we are looking into the early days of June for a potential second window and attempt. Is it a failure? In the most strict sense of the word, Absolutely. But is it a building block? For sure. I've always maintained that this is truly a journey vs. a summit sport. But to truly understand the whole process, you have to get to the summit.

Culturally, adventure is associated with adrenaline and sports that enduce a thrill. Adventure to me, though, is discovery. It is the peeling back of layers to reveal truth...the truth that is inside me or the truth that surrounds all of us.

In Mustang, Nepal, almost 10 years ago, I was fortunate enough to expienece the merging of the adventure of sport with the adventure of archeological discovery. Maybe I long to be back here over and over because of the lessons I learned, mostly about myself.

And a massive thanks to @espn for trusting me with this. //
The first time I photographed Alex Honnold was over a decade ago when our respective cars were our castles, means of transport, and kitchens. I remember the drive from Canada to Yosemite as a jittery sprint fueled by caffeine and gas station cashews. The pictures I took of Alex back then left me wanting, as if there were a depth to his character that was expressed through his action but escaped my ability as a photographer. He struck me as an athlete more sculpted by his medium than any other I’d met. I wondered if his physical form was a necessary response to repeated stimuli or if he represented something entirely unique. Photographing him all these years later was an opportunity to celebrate him as form born of the stone he surrounds himself with, seeing him as wholly human but somehow simultaneously transcendent of that definition. Plus, it’s not everyday you get to tell your friend to get naked and curl into a ball and NOT have that abruptly make your friendship forever awkward...

I tend to think that we bring our emotions to the mountains...and the mountains themselves are the planet's greatest mirror.

On the day I took this image in 2016, we climbed through snow and cloud. The heat caused by the convection cycle triggered repeated small avalanches that would rumble over seracs obscured by a thick fog on either side. This day, and the mood that I was bringing to it was reminiscent of a not so good day I had in the mountains several years ago when one of the distant rumbles became not so distant and engulfed my partners and I. My neuro-chemistry has never recovered.

That day I was looking in the mirror at a fear that I've never overcome. That day, because I was angry, the mountains were angry. As I climbed the slope beneath the seracs (which are almost as safe as they come), I felt my heart rate increase and my breathing become labored. I was scared, and that made me mad.

But the truth is the mountains are indiscriminate. They don't care. They shine when it is sunny and they fall when it is snowy. It's what we bring to them that defines our experience...and maybe even more important, its how we are changed by them and what we bring home and share that matters most.

I am excited, scared, humbled to experience how the mountains will change me on this new journey through a familiar - yet different - landscape.

This site has a fascinating history. These remains are the intentionally unfinished stupa project of King Bbodawpaya. The building of the temple took a tremendous toll on the state and resources and, as a result, a false prophecy was created to slowly stop the project. The prophecy has many iterations since creation, but it generally stated that when the project was complete the king would die. At abandonment, Mingun Pahtodawgi stood only 1/3 of it’s intended 150 meter height.

King Bodawpaya also had a 90 ton bell cast to accompany the pagoda, and it still, to this day, holds the record of the 2nd largest ringing bell in the world.

Thanks to @stevemccurryofficial for his tireless and beautiful work that has inspired me and so many other photographers. So much of what we create is reimagined images by those who have come before us. For their guidance, I'm eternally indebted.

Here are some words about the image I captured above from #NatgGeo #Explorer @jetbutterflies, who helped develop this story and assignment:
.
'A tantric mask rests on an ancient coat of armor in an unnamed ruin near the Tibetan border in Nepal. In Tibetan Buddhism, weapons of war and grotesque figures are used to scare away bad energy and ignorance.

In the isolated Mustang region of Nepal, Buddhist culture is adapting to a number of unexpected changes. The opening of the region to tourism in 1992 sparked an era of prosperity that inspired the revitalization of many ancient monasteries and breathed new life into a shrinking monastic population. Meanwhile, ancient artifacts and valuable religious icons started to go missing and appeared in international collections.'

I have a complicated relationship with social media, and regardless of the bad that comes with this platform, I have experienced the positive that comes with loudly and consistently vocalizing around the topic of Mental Health Awareness. It’s obvious that images of mountains and climbing get the most likes, BUT anytime I post about a personal struggle with mental health, I receive the most comments, private messages and emails. Veterans, stay-at-home parents, athletes, students, women, men..you name the type of person, I can guarantee they have reached out.
.
I encourage voicing the struggles you may experience if you struggle with Mental Health. You are not in this alone, and it’s not just about “being more happy.” Being vulnerable and vocalizing my challenges was the beginning of finding my individual way through PTSD + Anxiety. It helped me find the right people in my life -the ones that listen, care, empathize and understand. I also encourage anyone and everyone that struggles to find the right professional resources for them. The digital world provides opportunity to find and connect with professionals like never before. .
I also encourage those that might not understand what mental health is to google it, read about it, understand it. For a moment, imagine yourself in the skin of another that battles with mental health. Learn to empathize because I guarantee that if you aren’t experiencing it, you are surrounded by people that are. .
On this world Mental Health Day, I encourage you to share below your stories, resources and questions. We are already a community here, let’s use it to our advantage.

I admittedly oscillate between “woo-woo” and nihilism. Social media can amplify this, especially Instagram. I feel and see community as much as I experience FOMO and isolation. There’s as much support between the scrolls as there is fear of failure.

I’m going to err on the side of Woo-woo today and open up a conversation - I know a lot of you are following along more for my stories on #everest than my photojournalism or #mentalhealth awareness - regardless I put in the same energy, effort and exploration whether climbing or telling a story (mine or others). And the process of each of these journeys bring me tremendous joy as well as suffering. Different sides to the same coin.
I was reminded by that podcast, by going for a goal, it brings out aspects of you that wouldn’t come out otherwise, so when you reach your next “mountain top”, and mountain tops are endless, who’s with you are the people who are supposed to be with you based on what you have become. So, when you are going for a goal, it’s not about achieving, it's about who you are becoming on the way of bringing that goal to fruition.
I’d like to hear your thoughts - what are some journeys you’ve been on that have made you feel the greatest highs and the lowest lows? Does social media inspire you to keep achieving? Or does it just fill the gaps in-between the day? Do you find you have FOMO, how do you deal with it? Does it effect your goals?

In the spirit of these comments, I'd like to share an influential figure on this exact topic.
Recently, I watched a panel discussion that included Christiana Figueres (@cfigueres), the Executive Secretary of UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change) who lead the diplomatic collaboration of the Paris Agreement. She frequently uses the concept 'outrage + optimisim' in speaking about climate science. If you're looking to be inspired into action, her twitter account is has some great resources and her TED talk is exceptional, as well. Check her out.

The issue of #climatechange can be polarizing. As a human race, we form our belief systems around what we are taught was well as what we experience first hand. Every person has their own unique experience in life, which means we all have our own individual, and equally real, experience of the world.

I'm curious: What is your unique experience of climate change? What have you or haven't you seen first hand? What makes you believe what you believe?
I'm interested about all experiences. No wrong answer here.

Before I settle into Nepal for an upcoming assignment, I am honored to speak at CIMB Investment Bank’s Cooler Earth Summit in Kuala Lumpur. The summit looks to create action and positive impact while simultaneously showing that businesses can remain relevant and profitable along the way.

#Instagram has been a tremendous platform by which to evoke change and conversation around important topics. Beyond the infinite scroll, I, too, have a responsibility to use this “influence” wisely, and am actively engaged directly with brands, political organizations, and financiers as they continue to develop ways to mitigate their impacts.

Are there any specific brands or organizations that you wish to see change the way they do business?

DISCLAIMER: Eyerolling emo deep thoughts to follow. Proceed with caution. // I love portraiture above all forms of photography. We are such an amazing creature. We are both creative and destructive, kind and vicious, powerful and meek, beautiful and ugly. It's my belief however that the majority of us dont live in those binary arenas. Very few people are truly good or bad, black or white...rather, we are infinite shades of grey depending on the day, the hour, the minute...even the second. Thinking of ourselves in binary terms is an attempt at comfort which is an injustice that robs us of our unique complexities. And while I've found that all of us embody a multitude of different shades at any given moment, we are all pretty similar as well. For me, photography has often been a way to seize upon perceived differences in order to expose our overarching similarities as a human family and hopefully bring us closer together. Too see one another completely is to see ourselves, regardless of where we were born, the color of our skin, our gender, what language we speak, or which god we pray to. And while there is unspeakable evil in the world, the power of said darkness pales in comparison to the power we achieve when we see ourselves as a whole and constantly unfolding.

Similarly to last post, I witnessed first-hand the changing, melting landscape of pristine land. Since this #expedition, scientific studies have concluded that “ice mass loss from 2011-2015 has doubled compared to any previous time spans”. Glacier retreat has been widespread and has led to the creation of at least one new island. Ice wastage, which means the removal of snow or ice from a glacier, was historically relatively small, but accelerating ice loss is the new normal for FJL.

We don’t need to travel to the arctic to experience our changing environment. There are shifts occurring here in my home of the United States, which some of you have spoken about in yesterday’s post’s comment section. To me, this isn’t a political debate, so let’s continue the conversation about our experiences and how to personally shift to make better choices - better choices for ourselves and our present *and future* global community.

Been on a podcast kick lately and yesterday listened to one about the dichotomy between Belief and Doubt. Believing and doubting are very much two sides of the same coin for me. It follows me through life.. I believe I can accomplish the goals I attempt, yet the journey of exploring this potential success is littered with doubt. Or another example would be: Doubt feeds my discernment on the mountain keeping me safe. At the same time, intense doubt can create stagnation, preventing me from going deeper or trying harder, which as result, could end in final failure.

You all have the floor: Do you believe doubt is essential in having faith? It can be faith in anything. Goals, God, Love… Tell me the things.

STEP 1: A triple cleanser by Biophiliac, really good brand, they use soybean extract combined with organic microplastics.
STEP 2: A couple of toners, mainly the set you automatically get in the HP LaserJet Pro M102w Laser Printer G3Q35A.

STEP 3: For eye cream I actually use Simply Organic French Onion Dip Mix just make sure it's the 1.1 oz packet because you're dumb to use a whole jar.

STEP 4: This serum called Gunther's Gums it smells like chocolate, and tastes like it too. Make sure you get the big bottle because you'll go through it fast, especially during dessert.

STEP 5: Depends how I'm feeling, but I either go with a face oil like a soybean cooking oil or a hydrating mask from Elmer's glue and tea tree oil.
STEP 6: Obviously I can't go to bed without my night cream moisturizer, the brand is L'Oxidatione Reservoti Panini Avenatti Overnight Hydrating Facial Moisturizer. I get a tub of it from Lithuania.

The project started in November 2017, as a result of Magnum’s Live Lab in Paris. While in the French capital Depoorter was invited to visit an infamous strip club in the Pigalle district where she met Agata, a young dancer working at the club. Agata invited Depoorter back to her home and together they made the very first photographs in what was to become a years-long project. .
Earlier this year the pair travelled to Lebanon to continue the work, with the support of the @huaweinextimage Awards.

You can see the work on show at the NEXT-IMAGE Awards stands at Paris Photo from November 7 to 10. At the stand, @huawei will also be exhibiting the winning submissions from this year’s 520,000 entries.

“My life as a photographer has consisted of many travels across the African continent, a land impregnated with unusual, peculiar things, where unexpected moments can happen.
.
This picture was taken late one night in Brazzaville, Congo, in a neighborhood restaurant in the Poto-Poto district. It was taken with my Leica, after a hard day of work, almost without my knowledge.
.
A shadow like that of a Chinese (or should I say African?) puppet, lends itself to the game. Solicited by this ephemeral shadow, the wall agrees to participate. It proposes and positions the eye and the eyebrow to reveal this fugitive, invented profile, by capturing these shadows, framed by arms.
.
A photograph passes from one hand to another, a souvenir exchanged…
.
It was Sunday, October 27, 1985.” - Guy Le Querrec

“I was shooting in Mumbai city for a book project in 1996. I had heard of local trains arriving into the city with a human deluge that was unmeasurable, a flood of people who would then be dispersed to their places of work. Sure enough, I reached Churchgate railway station–the busiest place in the heart of the city–at 8 a.m. I stood there in awe and amazement, with an unimaginable and overpowering feeling of the deluge. It took less than a minute for thousands of commuters to disappear. The platform was empty again until 3 or 4 minutes later, when more trains arrived to bring in another deluge. .
More than the crowds, I wanted to capture so many human bodies melting into each other and disappearing in a mad rush to get to their respective places of work. So I put my camera on a 5 foot-high switch box almost in the middle of the space between two tracks and exposed it at one-eighth of a second in order to capture the deluge. But those sitting on the benches reading the morning newspaper or waiting for someone remained still. This expression is visible anytime of the day in most metropolitan cities in India.”- @raghurai.official

“In 1991, Iraq attacked Israel with Scud missiles over the course of six weeks. Israel, for the first time ever, refrained from retaliating, bowing to pressure from the United States, which was leading an offensive against Iraq. Because the missiles were capable of carrying chemical or biological warheads, Israelis were equipped with gas masks and instructed to seal off a room in their homes. Oddly, there was no solution for bearded men like myself, nor for pets, who could not wear the masks.
.
The day on which the first missile was launched the siren sounded and everybody gathered in the sealed room. I was ready to photograph it, with my equipment already in my car, when I heard the alarm, but as it was not clear yet whether the missile was ‘conventional’ or not, I decided to wait it out with my family–my wife, our two sons, and our house cat. So I photographed them.
.
As it turned out, the warheads did not contain unconventional materials but the damage that the 39 missiles caused was severe. Most of them landed not far from our home and we could hear every explosion. By the way, today there is free distribution of special masks for bearded people and a special solution for pets.”- Micha Bar-Am

“I was in Marrakech in 1986 during the Folklore Festival. Sitting on a dirt wall, there was a group of girls waiting to perform. As soon as they saw me taking pictures, they started hiding, covering their faces with their hands, then uncovering them slightly to look at me, then covering them again. It was like a game of seduction and, though they were quite young, they already seemed to know that to hide and to show were the basic rules of the game. They kept playing at it for a little while, laughing loudly. It would have been great to have the soundtrack with this image.”- Harry Gruyaert

'In 2017, while working on an exhibition commission on nuclear weapons for the Nobel Peace Prize, I applied for permission to visit the vast Nevada Air Force Base Complex–which is known for its lunar landscape, a result of all the nuclear weapons tests carried out there–but we were turned down. I was forced to be ‘outside looking in,’ driving along its perimeter and trying to metaphorically see what was hidden beyond those mountains. For the exhibition commission, I created a series of diptychs comparing American Cold War-era nuclear landscapes with present-day North Korean ones. Indeed, I was also kept out of the North Korean plants, and had to photograph from the Chinese side of their shared border, at the closest points to Pyongyang’s known nuclear and military sites.
.
In a similar way to other landscape imagery in my practice, the photograph–often taken to be, by nature, evidential–is almost counter-evidential in this case. Nothing is laid out in plain sight. These landscapes can be read with some imagination, to ‘see’ what lies beneath, beyond.' - @chiyin_sim

Nina Strand, one member of the award’s jury, said that The Coast is a “photobook that works on the same level as a challenging work of fiction'. Another jury member, Emma Bowkett, described the publication as, “a lyrical, political narrative with a strong, determined voice.”

“This charming photo shows legendary fashion photographer Richard Avedon and Hollywood superstar dancer Fred Astaire. They are both hiding from the rain and behind a large-format camera with playful smiles and practiced poses, all captured by Magnum’s co-founder, David ‘Chim’ Seymour. The three men were in Paris with Audrey Hepburn for the making of the film Funny Face, which earned four Academy Award nominations.
.
Avedon’s obituary in the The New York Times states that his ‘fashion and portrait photographs helped define America's image of style, beauty and culture for the last half-century.’ Astaire’s obituary noted that his ‘flashing feet and limber legs not only made him America's most popular dancer but also set standards for motion picture musical comedies that have rarely been met and never exceeded.’
.
Photographers often hide behind their cameras, but rarely do they allow themselves to be photographed in their secretive mode of work. Chim’s personal engagement with these two fabled stars enabled him to record this delightful encounter, which mocks the idea of hiding behind a camera.”- Ben Shneiderman, David Seymour’s nephew (www.davidseymour.com)

“In the years following September 11, 2001, I made many trips to Afghanistan. It is a place where much seems hidden.
.
I made this photograph in 2004. These guys were cleaning carpets by shaking out the dust. A Sisyphean task. Dust is one of the things about Afghanistan that I still remember in a visceral way. It was more like beige, talcum powder than dust, seeping into every crack and seam. I imagined that it must be like the dust on the moon (which is where going to Afghanistan felt like at the time). Thousands of years of dry, chalky rock, ground up underfoot until it did not even qualify as sand. .
And it destroyed cameras. At the time, I used Fuji 645 film cameras that had plastic gears in the internal workings. The dust would grind the teeth off the gears. My cameras had to be practically rebuilt after each trip. It became more costly to fix the cameras than to just get new ones.” - @oh_anderson/Magnum Photos

'The Walls is the oldest unit in the Texas prison, opened in 1849. Beginning in 1982, 562 men have died in its execution chambers. I spent most of 1968 walking around inside the Walls. I used the prints I was making for Conversations with the Dead , most of them in Bruce Davidson’s darkroom on W. 86th street, to apply for a Guggenheim Fellowship. Afterward the foundation asked if they could have one of the prints. It was The Dominoes Players. In the 1990s, Magnum sent that roll of negatives to a printer for an enlargement and for some reason the printer cut the frame off from the strip of six, frame 36, the last image on the roll. Another decade went by and Magnum decided my original cellulose negative sleeves were not archival so all the prison negatives were moved from the original sleeves into archival paper sleeves. Only the person doing this neglected to look inside the originals for a single separated frame. The old sleeves were burned in the garbage and that was the end of the negative of one of the best pictures I would ever make. I had a single surviving vintage print, and with the arrival of the digital age, it was scanned allowing these small prints to be made. ' - @dannylyonphotos

“The Kayan Lahwi people live in the state of Kayah in Myanmar. They are farmers and Buddhists. The Kayan Lahwi women traditionally wear brass rings around their necks. I don't know when this strange custom began. Tourists, Thai or foreign, call these women ‘Long Neck’ or ‘Giraffe’ ladies.
.
A small area has been set up for tourists, who have to pay fees to enter. Most of these fees, I fear, go directly to the officials. Back in the 1930s, Englishmen took several ‘Long Neck’ women to London to show them at a circus. Indeed, when I took a group tour there once, I was horrified to see tourists acting as though they were visiting a circus, a zoo even. .
I went back there alone twice in the early morning. It was then that I could see a piece of their normal, daily life.” - Hiroji Kubota

“From time immemorial people have sought protection and freedom on the banks of the Yenisei River, whose stream I followed. My journey took me to Tyva Republic, where the Yenisei starts its journey. Arriving in Tyva in southern Siberia left a vivid mark on my memory. On the drive there, as you climb higher and higher, you cross endless forests and mountains. People I passed on the way warned me that although Tyva belongs to Russia it is like the Wild West. Suddenly, as I crossed the mountains, the forests ended, and the land opened out in front of me. I was engulfed by heat. I had entered the Tyva Republic: It felt like entering a different world. .
On the day this picture was taken, a horse race was taking place. It was 43 degrees celsius and the boys had to race 30 km. The young rider shook off the rest of the group. For one moment it felt as though he was riding in the middle of the steppe alone, all by himself.” - @nannaheitmann

“I almost never use telephoto lenses to shoot because I don’t like the idea of ‘stealing’ images from a distance. I want to be seen so that if some people don’t want to be photographed–which unfortunately occurs nowadays more and more often–they can let me know or hide themselves.
.
In the case of this image, taken in 1978, I used a 1000mm telephoto lens, because a photographic magazine had asked me to test it. Though the couple really were in love and passionate, they were friends of mine and were perfectly aware of this situation. The Seine river was overflowing and I asked them to go on a bank half-covered by the water. .
It’s therefore perhaps a fake ‘hidden’ picture, though of real lovers at that time!” - @pzachmann

“I was staying in a Mennonite colony in Durango, in 1994, with Bill Thiessen’s family. It was a Sunday afternoon when, after church, teenagers walked the colony roads to flirt. I stopped the car and got out just as a group of young women hid their faces and ran into an explosion of dust and wind. Once they passed, they stopped, put their hats back on top of their heads, and continued to laugh and talk in search of boys.” - @larrysgeneralstore

Since I was young, I have always felt that spending time in a black barbershop was equivalent to attending church. Each visit was a shared ritualistic experience among the male clients. Everything was discussed; everyone in the shop was close to the action. It was a place of shared mysteries where grown men spoke amongst themselves, sharing life experiences with young boys in a casual way. It carried great weight for the latter who sat quietly listening and learning. It was an educational experience they’d keep close to their hearts for the rest of their lives.” - @elireedmagnum

Arthur's signed print is available until Friday via the link in bio. .
“The notion of being hidden is pretty well established in Saudi Arabia: most obviously, women inside their abayas and niqabs, but also families behind the high walls of their houses, and young men and women who are separated from each other in public spaces. But the concept of what is hidden also depends on who is looking. Being hidden from one’s family or from the religious police might also mean being hidden from the rules, and subsequently enjoying the chance to be more liberal.
.
This image was taken in Durrat Al-Arous, a beach town just outside Jeddah where families and young people come on the weekend to relax. Because it is privately owned, the rules of Saudi society don’t apply and young people can hang out together, wear what they like; women can drive cars or ride bikes. So in a way people are hidden from the rule-makers, and that allows them to be less hidden from one another.” - @oliviarthur
